Despite its relative heft and power it never fails to deliver its dense, dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco flavours with anything other than supreme elegance and finesse.

    "description": "Founded in 1580, Argiano is one of the most prestigious and historic estates in Montalcino. Produced from Sangiovese grapes utilising a combination of young and old vines this Brunello is Argiano’s calling card. Many thought that the 2015 vintage in Tuscany would be difficult to beat, but 2016 proved that it was possible, with many spectacularly intense, complex and ageworthy wines produced. This powerful and tannic release will benefit greatly from additional cellaring and should drink well from 2024 onwards.",
