    "description": "The 2016 Masseto exhibits seamless pedigree and represents a textbook vintage. Despite its relative heft and power it never fails to deliver its dense, dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco flavours with anything other than supreme elegance and finesse. An iconic release which scored 100pts from The Wine Advocate",

    "description": "This is the more powerful wine of Il Borghetto's two pure Sangioveses. Sinewy, muscular tannins give the Monte de Sassi considerable punch and drive. Like all of these wines, the Montedesassi is quite perfumed and savoury in style. Robert Parker, 91 Points",

    "description": "Founded in 1580, Argiano is one of the most prestigious and historic estates in Montalcino. Produced from Sangiovese grapes utilising a combination of young and old vines this Brunello is Argianoâ€™s calling card. Many thought that the 2015 vintage in Tuscany would be difficult to beat, but 2016 proved that it was possible, with many spectacularly intense, complex and ageworthy wines produced. This powerful and tannic release will benefit greatly from additional cellaring and should drink well from 2024 onwards.",

    "description": "A rich and concentrated Valpolicella with aromas of peppery tobacco and spice. Rich red fruits on the round and balanced palate combine with savoury notes through to a long, luscious finish. We started working with Roccolo Grassi 10 years ago and have been consistently impressed with their outstanding quality. Marco Sartori is a driven man and in a few short years he has gone from making his first vintage to becoming one of the top talents in the region.",
