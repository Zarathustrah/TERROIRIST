    "description": "100% Legrein from the Alto Adige region of northern Italy. Grapes are hand-harvested before being destemmed and slowly fermetned in standard steel tanks. The wine is racked off to a combination of large, inactive wooden barrels and smaller, new oak barrels for ageing before blending and bottling takes place 12 months later. Earthy and mineral on the nose with notes of morello cherry, dark chocolate and plum jam. The palate is spicy and fruity before an opulent finish.",

    "description": "Founded in 1580, Argiano is one of the most prestigious and historic estates in Montalcino. Produced from Sangiovese grapes utilising a combination of young and old vines this Brunello is Argiano’s calling card. Many thought that the 2015 vintage in Tuscany would be difficult to beat, but 2016 proved that it was possible, with many spectacularly intense, complex and ageworthy wines produced. This powerful and tannic release will benefit greatly from additional cellaring and should drink well from 2024 onwards.",

The result is a crisply defined, tensile and fine-grained wine, with lovely notes of dark cherry, spices, earth and mocha. Though perfect for drinking now, there is ample mid-palate density and textural tannic framework to suggest cellaring for up to 10 years should be no problem.",
